# SX variables - TL;DR: matrices with elements that are sequences unary or binary operations
"""
The SX data type is used to represent matrices whose elements consist
of symbolic expressions made up by a sequence of unary and binary operations.
"""
xs = SX.sym("x")
ys = SX.sym("y", 10, 2)

# MX variables - TL;DR: like SX, but elements are not limited to unary or binary operations
# Note: SX variables often result in a better performance when solving big optimization problems,
#       compared to MX variables
"""
The MX type allows, like SX, to build up expressions consisting of a sequence
of elementary operations. But unlike SX, these elementary operations are not
restricted to be scalar unary or binary operations. Instead, the elementary
operations that are used to form MX expressions are allowed to be general
multiple sparse-matrix valued input, multiple sparse-matrix valued output functions.
"""
xm = MX.sym("x")
ym = MX.sym("y", 10, 2)


# DM variables - TL;DR: represents all purely numeric variables
"""
DM is very similar to SX, but with the difference that the nonzero elements are
numerical values and not symbolic expressions. The syntax is also the same, except
for functions such as SX.sym, which have no equivalents.
